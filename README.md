# Paging-Crawler

# What it does

1. Scraping the title, category, date, and contents of each service from [this website](https://www.data.go.kr/useCase/exam/index.do).
2. Paging the website by clicking the paging button

# Caution

1. This code was originally made to crawl the data of [this website](https://www.data.go.kr/useCase/exam/index.do).
However, if your project requires paging, you can transform this code to make this fit for your project.
I've added annotation on the code.
2. Make sure you have the Chrome Driver which version matches with your Chrome version and place it on the proper route. The Chrome Driver can be downloaded [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
